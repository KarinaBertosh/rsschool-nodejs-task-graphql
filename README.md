## Assignment: Graphql

Added logic to the graphql endpoint: **_./src/routes/graphql_**.  
Constraints and logic for gql queries should be done based on restful implementation.

1.  Implemented configuration of queries and mutations. You can check this by running **_npm run test-queries_** Ð¸ **_npm run test-mutations_**
2.  Implemented limiting the complexity of Graphql queries based on their depth. You can check this by running **_npm run test-rule_**
